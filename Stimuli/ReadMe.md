# Stimuli for studying Dynamic Binuaral Processing

This folder contains the code to generate many of the stimuli used in the study of Dynamic Binaural Processing

<ol>
<li> IACtSquare_ToneDetect.m is used to study the dynamics of spatial unmasking
</li>
<li> IACsinAFC3.m was used to do a 3AFC OSCOR task </li>
<ol>
<li> OSCOR.m is a script to quickly generate a OSCOR stimulus
</li>
</ol>
<li> The remaining scripts are involved with generating the binaural mseq stimulus for EEG </li>
</ol>
